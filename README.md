# Programming-logic

Welcome to my Logic Programmer's Repository! Here, I showcase three distinct JavaScript projects that I've developed to strengthen my skills in logic programming. These projects offer a practical exploration of logic-based concepts applied to game-related scenarios.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Hero Level Classifier
   - Description: The Hero Level Classifier is a JavaScript project that involves classifying heroes in a game based on their attributes. Through logical analysis and decision-making, the classifier determines the appropriate level for each hero, adding a strategic layer to character progression.
   - Technologies: JavaScript, Logic Programming

### 2. Ranked Match Calculator
   - Description: The Ranked Match Calculator is a JavaScript application designed to calculate match rankings in a gaming context. Leveraging logic programming principles, this project factors in various parameters to determine player rankings after each match, providing a fair and competitive ranking system.
   - Technologies: JavaScript, Logic Programming

### 3. Game Class Implementation
   - Description: In this project, I've implemented various classes within a game using JavaScript. These classes cover essential aspects of game development, such as characters, abilities, and interactions. This project serves as a hands-on exercise in writing effective and efficient classes for gaming scenarios.
   - Technologies: JavaScript, Logic Programming
